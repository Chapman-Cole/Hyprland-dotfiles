Notable applications in use:
 - greetd (similar to SDDM or GDM, but just launches into gui)
 - nwg-hello (a greeter for greetd, the thing that provides the gui)
    (note: right now I am not using nwg-hello, instead I have greetd just launch hyprland directly as my user Cole and then enable hyprlock at startup)
  - nwg-look (handles gtk theming)
     - I use the catpuccin mauve theme
 - rofi (for launching applications)
   - Got rofi themes from https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi
 - hyprshell (provides alt-tab and windows-tab like functionality)
 - nautilus (the primary file explorer, the one I have found I like the best)
 - waybar (provides the bar at the top of the screen)
 - hyprlock (provides the lock screen for hyprland, separate from nwg-hello)
 - xdg-desktop-portal (provides varied functionality for many apps)
 - hyprland (the wayland compositor)
 - yay (allows me to install packages from the arch user repository)
 - kitty (the terminal emulator I like to use)
 - Note: sometimes it is necessary to modify the .desktop files in order to launch natively with wayland (usually adding something like --ozone). This fixs certain issues with popup windows
 - kvantum (used to manage qt themes)
 - qt5ct and qt6ct-kde (the latter is from yay) to manage the themes
 - celluloid (a nice looking GTK based video player, uses mpv as a backend)
 - mpv (the video backend for celluloid)
 - hyprshot (handles screenshots)
 - OCR4linux (allows for recognition of words and numbers from a screenshot)
 - my favorite theme for GTK and qt: catpuccin-macchiato-mauve
 - qt5-wayland and qt6-wayland are also good ideas to download
 - Gnome text editor is a good, simple text editor
 - xdg-user-dirs (creates the basic desktop folders like picures, downloads, etc.)
 - xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (manages a lot of important stuff)
 - gnome-keyring
 - pipewire and its derivaties
 - network-manager
 - os-prober for dual booting with windows
 - For github-desktop, launch with github-desktop --disable-gpu in order to make it open faster on wayland
 - In order to get rid of the logging that shows on startup, just modify the greetd config.toml so that it routes the output of Hyprland call to a file
